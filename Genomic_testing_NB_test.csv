"Preventive measures are effective if adequate and well-founded information on the risks of diseases is provided, for which accurate diagnostic screening tests and laboratory tests are essential",Genetic Diagnostic Testing
we participate in campaigns and screenings to provide comprehensive patient information. SYNLAB considers it an important task to promote a long-term reduction in the costs of the health system in all countries where it is active,Genetic Diagnostic Testing
"PentaCore Laboratory is a unique, customer-centric laboratory in Hungary, performing laboratory and genetic testing in a high quality, which is available in Budapest, at the I.sz Internal Medicine Clinic of Semmelweis University. ",Genetic Diagnostic Testing
" Our extensive private laboratory diagnostic service is freely available to everyone, prior medical referral is recommended before performing the tests, but it is not necessary.",Genetic Diagnostic Testing
"genetic testing,genetic testing finderOur proposed genetic tests for family planning before having children, our genetic testing for diseases",Genetic Diagnostic Testing
"Genetic test susceptibility to celiac disease,Genetic test to rule out celiac disease",Genetic Diagnostic Testing
Genetic predisposition is necessary for the development of celiac disease in more than 99% of cases. This test does not need to be done on an empty stomach.,Genetic Diagnostic Testing

Positron emission tomography is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals as molecular probes that map in vivo the spatial distribution of body metabolic and biochemical activitie,Diagnostic Imaging
"computed tomography (CT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI), which provide morphological information",Diagnostic Imaging
"The method combines, in a single gantry, a PET scanner and a CT scanner to acquire co-recorded sequential images in which the functional process is anatomically located. ",Diagnostic Imaging
"For the first time in PET reconstruction, there is no need for compromises between excellent image quality and quantitative accuracy, indispensable tools for accurate diagnosis and precise evaluation of treatment response",Diagnostic Imaging
" Because motion artifacts can cause significant image distortion, the PET/TC scanner is equipped with a respiratory gating system that can correct respiratory movemen",Diagnostic Imaging
"bout CT Lung and Cardiovascular Docks at our clinic By measuring visceral fat and subcutaneous fat with low-dose CT, it is examined for visceral fat type or subcutaneous fat type",Diagnostic Imaging
"erena (China) Medical Technology Co., Ltd. is a company with advanced genetic testing technology,",Molecular Diagnostics
"The vast majority of single-gene genetic diseases do not have effective treatment drugs, early detection and early diagnosis is the primary criterion for improving the quality of life of patients with single-gene genetic diseases",Molecular Diagnostics
Single-gene genetic diseases are divided into explicit and recessive genetics,Molecular Diagnostics
"nvisible Genetic Diseases: Sources of Birth Defects That Cannot Be Ignored - Unrelated to family history - Not related to maternal age Due to the normal phenotype of the carrier of recessive genetic disease, routine prenatal examination during the birth of offspring is oftenuntestable, causing mutations to be transmitted from generation to generation, until the carrier's parents gave birth to the child was not found.",Molecular Diagnostics
